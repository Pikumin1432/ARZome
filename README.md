# Arzome

Argument Reality for Zome construction.

One can place a Zome model generated from a .vef file as a virtual object on the
display.  Therefore, by adjusting it to a half-constructed phisical Zome model,
one can construct complicated 3D Zome models easily.
It works for  iphone (iphone 8 or later) snd iPad (iPad pro) .

# Usage

1. Put .vef files (Scott Vorthmann's vZome format) of the models you want to construct in the folder ARZome/model.

2. Compile it with Xcode and put the app into the device.

3. Choose the .vef file name and tap "show".  Then it appears in front of the smartphone.  

4. First, it is fixed to the camera coordinate.  Therefore, adjust it to the physical model under construction, and tap the release button to fix it to the world coordinate.

5. You can repeat the catch (fix it to the camera coordinate) and relase
(fix it to the world coordinate) for ajustment.

6. Recommended to use phone neck holder so that you can use both hands for assembling.
