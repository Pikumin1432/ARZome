ARZome

Argument Reality for Zome construction.

One can place a Zome model generated from a .vef file (Scott Vorthmann's vZome format) in the virtual space of a smarphone. By adjusting it to a half-constructed physical Zome model, one can construct complicated 3D Zome models easily. It works for iPhone (iPhone 8 or later) and iPad (iPad Pro) .
Usage

    Put .vef files in the folder ARZome/model.

    Compile it with Xcode and put the app into the device.

    Choose the .vef file name and tap "show". Then the virtual Zome object appears. First, it is fixed to the world coordinate.

    You can "catch" it (fix it to the camera coordinate), move your smartphone, and "release" it (fix it to the world coordinate).

    Repeat "catch" and "relase" to ajust the virtual model to the half-constructed physical model. Then, one can easily see how to connect the struts.

    Recommended to use phone neck holder so that you can use both hands for assembling.
